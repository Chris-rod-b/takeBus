# APP TakeBus

## React Native School Expo Template Used

A simple Expo template with the following features:

- Eslint & Prettier configured
- React Navigation v6
- Testing Configured
- Simple project structure
- Small component library to get started with

It's easy to create a project, strip out the few components included, and still have the architecture in place to quickly start building an app.
